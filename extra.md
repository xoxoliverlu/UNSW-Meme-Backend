Chosen bonus feature(s): Database
Explanation (~100 words): 
I chose to integrate mongoDB as a part of my bonus feature. I registered a mongoDb Atlas account and connect to their online cluster
to store the UNSW Memes data. I use mongoose as a driver and object document mapper to connect to mongo. All the schemas are matched with 
our typescript interface definition so that the data saved into the database will be type compliant.
